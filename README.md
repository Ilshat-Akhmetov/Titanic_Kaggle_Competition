## Titanic_Kaggle_Competition
Here i implemented a pipepilne to develop a model prediction 
if a passenger survives or not based on available data.

This competition used accuracy as a score to compare different solutions and find out 
which one is the best.

I achieved score - 0.79425 and got into top 5% of participants.
