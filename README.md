## Titanic_Kaggle_Competition
Here i implemented a pipepilne to develop a ml-model predicting
if a passenger survived or not the travel on Titanic based on available data. 
I also compared performance of seveal ml-models such as catBoost, RandomForest, LogisticRegression.
Here RandomForest showed the best result.

This competition used accuracy as a score to compare different solutions and find out 
which one is the best.


I achieved score - 0.79665 and got into top 5% of participants.
